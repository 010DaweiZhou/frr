  * New upstream release. 
    - [bgpd] The semantics of default-originate route-map have changed.
      The route-map is now used to advertise the default route conditionally.
      The old behaviour which allowed to set attributes on the originated
      default route is no longer supported.
    - [bgpd] this version of bgpd implements draft-idr-error-handling.  This was
      added in 0.99.21 and may not be desirable.  If you need a version
      without this behaviour, please use 0.99.20.1.  There will be a
      runtime configuration switch for this in future versions.
    - [isisd] is in "beta" state.
    - [ospf6d] is in "alpha/experimental" state
    - More changes are documented in the upstream changelog!

quagga (0.99.5-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added default PAM file and some explanations regarding PAM authentication
    of vtysh which could prevent the start at boot-time when used wrong. 
    Now PAM permits anybody to access the vtysh tool (a malicious user could
    build his own vtysh without PAM anyway) and the access is controled by
    the read/write permissions of the vtysh socket which are only granted to
    users belonging to the quaggavty group (thanks to Wakko Warner).

  * The patch which tried to remove the OpenSSL dependency, which is
    not only unneccessary but also a violation of the licence and thus RC,
    stopped working a while ago, since autoreconf is no longer run before
    building the binaries. So now ./configure is patched directly (thanks
    to Faidon Liambotis for reporting). Closes: #306840

    respect to ospfd. [...] 0.98.2 has been released, with one crucial change 
    to fix the unfortunate mistake in 0.98.1, which caused problems if 
    ospfd became DR.  
  * Note: the upstream tarball had a strange problem, apparently redhat.spec
    was twice in it? At least debuild gave a strange error message so I
    unpacked it by hand. No changes were made to the .orig.tar.gz!
